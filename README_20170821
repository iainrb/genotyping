This is a branch for troubleshooting Sequenom upload of older data (2009-10).
It was set up in response to ticket RT#586714 and is not intended for
merging to the main wtsi-npg/devel branch.

Additional scripts in this branch include:

- find_sequenom_plate_by_sample.pl
- find_sequenom_plate_well_by_sample.pl
- find_sequenom_study_group_by_sample.pl
- find_sequenom_study_sample_details.pl
- update_selected_sequenom_metadata.pl

Relevant queries have been added to the Sequenom (mspec2) and Sequencescape
database modules.

The 'update' script adds sample name, sample ID, and study AVUs and group
read permission to given iRODS paths.
